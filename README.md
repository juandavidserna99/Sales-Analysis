# Sales-Analysis
### Case study: Analyze Sales
The dataset used contains hundreds of thousands of mostly electronic product sales data that were stored for 12 months and we have data specifically on product type, cost, purchase address, ect. The following questions were resolved:
1. What was the best month for sales? How much was earned that month?
2. What city sold the most product?
3. What time should we display advertisements to maximize the likelihood of a customerâ€™s buying a product?
4. What products are most often sold together?
5. What product sold the most? Why do you think it sold the most?
